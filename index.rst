Welcome to SublimeLinter 3
==========================
|_sl| is a plugin for |_st| that provides a framework for linting code. Whatever language you code in, |sl| can help you write cleaner, better, more bug-free code. |sl| has been designed to provide maximum flexibility and usability for users and maximum simplicity for linter authors.

The documentation for |sl| is divided into two sections: one for users, and one for developers who would like to create their own linter plugins.
