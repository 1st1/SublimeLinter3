SublimeLinter 3.0.5

*** IMPORTANT! ***

Please use github issues only for verified bugs. If you have a general
usage question, or are having trouble with installation or configuration,
please use the SublimeLinter google group. That way everyone will
benefit from the answer.

Even if you suspect there is a bug, it's better to ask on the group first
and then file an issue on github only after it has been confirmed that it's a bug.
