SublimeLinter 3.0.5
--------------------

*** IMPORTANT! ***

Please use github issues only for verified bugs. If you have a general
usage question, or are having trouble with installation or configuration,
please use the SublimeLinter google group. That way everyone will
benefit from the answer.

Even if you suspect there is a bug, it's better to ask on the group first
and then file an issue on github only after it has been confirmed that it's a bug.

*** KEYBOARD CHANGES ***

The Mac OS X keyboard equivalent for Show All Errors is now Control+Command+A.


*** KEEP SUBLIMELINTER ALIVE! ***

I have now spent two solid months on SublimeLinter, and now that it is
released the support load is quite heavy -- 36 hours in the last three
days alone.

I am very grateful to everyone who has donated so far to support
SublimeLinter. But many have not. If everyone who relies on SublimeLinter
donated even a few dollars, I wouldn't have to worry. But the reality is
that without more financial support, I simply cannot continue to provide
the same level of support for SublimeLinter.

I'm sorry to have to beg for donations, but open source software is not free
-- the developers usually end up paying for it!

Thank you for your support!
